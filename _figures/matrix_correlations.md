title: "Maps of the matrix protein."
description: "The RSA-Distance model predication versus empricial $$ dN/dS $$ correlation plotted onto the matrix protein structure. Red colors represent relatively high correlations. Blue colors represent relatively low correlations. The correlations control for RSA. The volume containing the matrix protein colored cartoon is the surface plot of the entire trimeric functional matrix complex. In A, we show a front view of the correlation map. In B, we show the side view of the correlations map."

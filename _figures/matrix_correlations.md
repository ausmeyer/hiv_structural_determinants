title: "Correlation maps of matrix."
description: "The distance-rsa model predication versus empricial dN/dS correlation plotted onto the capsid structure. Red colors represent highly negative correlations--sites closer to those sites are are evolving more rapidly. Blue colors represent highly positive correlations--sites farther from those sites are evolving more rapidly. The correlations control for RSA. The volume containing the capsid colored cartoon is the surface plot of the entire hexameric functional capsid complex. In A, we show a front view of the correlation map. In B, we show the side view of the correlations map."

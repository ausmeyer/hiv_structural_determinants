title: "Correlation maps of matrix protein."
description: "The distance-rsa model predication versus empricial dN/dS correlation plotted onto the matrix protein structure. Red colors represent highly negative correlations--sites closer to those sites are are evolving more rapidly. Blue colors represent highly positive correlations--sites farther from those sites are evolving more rapidly. The correlations control for RSA. The volume containing the matrix protein colored cartoon is the surface plot of the entire trimeric functional matrix building blocks. In A, we show a front view of the correlation map on the matrix protein. In B, we show the front view of the matrix protein.

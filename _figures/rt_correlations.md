title: "Maps of the reverse transcriptase complex."
description: "The volume is the surface plot of the entire dimeric reverse transcriptase complex; a reverse transcriptase monomer is shown as a cartoon. In A and B, we show the RSA-Distance model-predicted versus empirical $$ dN/dS $$ correlation plotted onto the reverse transcriptase structure. Red colors represent relatively high correlations--regions in red are on average experiencing more rapid evolution. Blue colors represent relatively low correlations--regions in blue are on average experiencing slower evolution. The correlations control for RSA. In C and D, we show the predicted $$ dN/dS $$ from the RSA-Distance combined model. Sites that are red are predicted to be evolving more rapidly and those in blue are predicted to be evolving more slowly."

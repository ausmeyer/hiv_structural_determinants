title: "Maps of the reverse transcriptase complex."
description: "The volume containing the reverse transcriptase colored cartoon is the surface plot of the entire dimeric reverse transcriptase complex. In A and B, we show the distance-rsa model prediction versus empricial dN/dS correlation plotted onto the reverse transcriptase structure. Red colors represent relatively high correlations--regions in red are on average experiencing more rapid evolution. Blue colors represent relatively low correlations--regions in blue are on average experiencing slower evolution. The correlations control for RSA. In C and D, we show the predicted dN/dS from the distance-rsa combined model. Sites that are red are predicted to be evolving more rapidly and those in blue are predicted to be evolving more slowly. In D, we add glycosylations to the predicted dN/dS structure."

title: "Comparing combined distance-rsa with distance-only models."
description: "The combined model and distance-only correlations on the protease structure. Red colors represent low correlations--sites closer to those sites are are evolving more rapidly. Blue colors represent high correlations--sites farther from those sites are evolving more rapidly. The correlations on the structure on the right control for RSA and those on the right do not."

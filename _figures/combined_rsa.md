title: "$$ R^{2} $$ of combined model versus RSA-only model"
description: "Scatter plot of the $$ R^{2} $$ from the combined and cross validated test set versus that of the RSA - only model. A separate color was used for each protein. Although there appears to be a relationship between the combined and RSA-only models, there is not sufficient power in the data to produce a significant correlation (p = 0.076)."

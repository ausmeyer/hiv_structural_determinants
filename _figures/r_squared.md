title: "R<sup>2</sup> for models and datasets."
description: "The ($$ R^{2} $$) value for each of the proteins and models tested in this study. The colors represent the model and data set that was used for fitting. The red and green plots include the combined distance-rsa model. In red, we construct optimized linear models with ($$ dN/dS $$) values and distances to 75% of the sites; we still include all reference sites, but only 75% of the distances from that site. In green, we show the ($$ R^{2} $$) value for the 25% of data that was not used for optimization using the best site from the optimized set. In blue, we show the ($$ R^{2} $$)  value of a model that only uses RSA as a predictor for ($$ dN/dS $$)."

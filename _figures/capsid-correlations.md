title: "Maps of the capsid protein."
description: "The volume containing the capsid protein colored cartoon is the surface plot of the entire hexameric functional capsid protein complex. In A, we show the predicted rates using the distance-rsa combined model. Sites that are red are predicted to be evolving more rapidly and those in blue are predicted to be evolving more slowly. In B, the distance-rsa model predication versus empricial ($$ dN/dS $$) correlation plotted onto the capsid structure. Red colors represent relatively high correlations--regions in red are on average experiencing more rapid evolution. Blue colors represent relatively low correlations--regions in blue are on average experiencing slower evolution. The correlations control for RSA."

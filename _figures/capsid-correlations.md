title: "Correlation maps of the capsid protein."
description: "The distance-rsa model predication versus empricial dN/dS correlation plotted onto the capsid structure. Red colors represent relatively high correlations. Blue colors represent relatively low correlations. The correlations control for RSA. The volume containing the capsid protein colored cartoon is the surface plot of the entire hexameric functional capsid protein complex. In A, we show a front view of the correlation map. In B, we show the side view of the correlations map."

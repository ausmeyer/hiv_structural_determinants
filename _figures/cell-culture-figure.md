title: "Side view of the correlation heat map of gp120."
description: "The distance versus dN/dS correlation plotted on to the gp120 structure. Red colors represent highly negative correlations--sites closer to those sites are are evolving more rapidly. Blue colors represent highly positive correlations--sites farther from those sites are evolving more rapidly."

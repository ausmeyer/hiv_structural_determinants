description: "The volume is a surface plot of the entire trimeric functional protease complex; a single protease monomer is shown in cartoon. In A, we show the predicted rates using the RSA-Distance combined model. Sites that are red are predicted to be evolving more rapidly and those in blue are predicted to be evolving more slowly. In B, the RSA-Distance model-predicted versus empirical $$ dN/dS $$ correlation is plotted onto the protease structure. Red colors represent relatively high correlations--regions in red are on average experiencing more rapid evolution. Blue colors represent relatively low correlations--regions in blue are on average experiencing slower evolution. The correlations control for RSA."

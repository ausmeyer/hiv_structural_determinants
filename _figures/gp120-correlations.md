title: "Correlation maps of gp120."
description: "The distance-rsa model predication versus empricial dN/dS correlation plotted onto the gp120 structure. Red colors represent relatively high correlations. Blue colors represent relatively low correlations. The correlations control for RSA. The volume containing the gp120 colored cartoon is the surface plot of the entire gp120/gp41 ecto domain of the HIV receptor-binding complex. In A, we show a front view of the correlation map without any glycosylations. In B, we show the front view with glycosylations in pale blue tint. In C, we show the side view of the correlation map without glycosylations. In D, we show the side view of the correlation map with glycosylations."

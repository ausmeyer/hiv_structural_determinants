title: "Maps of the gp120 protein."
description: "The volume is the surface plot of the entire trimeric gp120/gp41 ecto domain of the HIV receptor-binding complex; a gp120 monomer is shown in cartoon. In A and B, we show the RSA-Distance model-predicted versus empricial $$ dN/dS $$ correlation plotted onto the gp120 structure. Red colors represent relatively high correlations--regions in red are on average experiencing more rapid evolution. Blue colors represent relatively low correlations--regions in blue are on average experiencing slower evolution. The correlations control for RSA. In B, we add glycosylations to the structure. In C and D, we show the predicted $$ dN/dS $$ from the RSA-Distance combined model. Sites that are red are predicted to be evolving more rapidly and those in blue are predicted to be evolving more slowly. In D, we add glycosylations to the predicted dN/dS structure."

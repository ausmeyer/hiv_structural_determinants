title: "Correlation maps of gp120."
description: "The distance versus dN/dS correlation plotted onto the gp120 structure. Red colors represent highly negative correlations--sites closer to those sites are are evolving more rapidly. Blue colors represent highly positive correlations--sites farther from those sites are evolving more rapidly. The correlations control for RSA. The volume containing the gp120 colored cartoon is the surface plot of the entire gp120/gp41 ecto domain of the HIV receptor-binding complex. In A, we show a front view of the correlation map without any glycosylations. In B, we show the front view with glycosylations in pale blue tint. In C, we show the side view of the correlation map without glycosylations. In D, we show the side view of the correlation map with glycosylations."

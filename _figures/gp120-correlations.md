title: "Maps of gp120 protein."
description: "The volume containing the gp120 colored cartoon is the surface plot of the entire trimeric gp120/gp41 ecto domain of the HIV receptor-binding complex. In A and B, we show the distance-rsa model predication versus empricial dN/dS correlation plotted onto the gp120 structure. Red colors represent relatively high correlations--regions in red are on average experiencing more rapid evolution. Blue colors represent relatively low correlations--regions in blue are on average experiencing slower evolution. The correlations control for RSA. For reference, we add glycosylations to the structure in B. In C and D, we show the predicted dN/dS from the distance-rsa combined model. Sites that are red are predicted to be evolving more rapidly and those in blue are predicted to be evolving more slowly. In D, we add glycosylations to the predicted dN/dS structure."

Viruses tend to be acutely adapted to use the receptor of one species, with the unintentional consequence of being poorly adapted to the receptor encoded by related species. 

This hypothesis could be tested with our simulation algorithm. Basically, we could start with two orthologs and one virus that are diverged at various levels from 0% to say 50% of of which we know that one binds above some threshold. Then, we evolve the infecting partner while enforcing binding and stability. At every time point, we check to see if that virus can infect the orthologous partner. That would tell us what the probability of these events are expected to be.

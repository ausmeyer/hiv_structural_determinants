The HIV genome encodes 15 proteins that can be divided into three general categories. The first, the enzymes, are all encoded by *pol* gene. There are three separate enzyme proteins encodes by the *pol* gene. They are, in the order of their reference genome numbering, protease, reverse transcriptase (including the RNase H domain), and integrase. Each of these three enzymes assumes a homodimeric quaternary structure and all three have clinically available inhibitory drugs. The second category of proteins encoded by the HIV genome are the structural proteins; they are encoded by two different genes in HIV. The matrix, capsid, and nucleocapsid are purely structural and are coded for in the *gag* gene. Alternatively, the external glycoprotein (gp120) and transmembrane glycoprotein (gp41) are encoded by the *env* gene, and serve as the primary human receptor-binding and uptake functions for the virus. The third category of HIV proteins make up a disparate mix of accessory and regulatory functions for the virus. These proteins include vpu, vif, vpr, p6, nef, rev, and tat. For this study, we have chosen to focus on the enzymes and structural proteins. Specifically we analyze sequence data and structures for protease, reverse transcriptase, integrase, the matrix and capsid proteins as well as the apical portion of the ectodomain of the HIV glycoprotein, gp120.

We have surveyed structural predictors of ($$ dN/dS $$) in HIV-1. We found that the common structural predictors used in other viruses show mixed results for HIV. We found that neither the structural proteins nor the enzymes show a common pattern of either adaptive evolution or modeling accuracy. Evolution could only be modeled in one of the structural proteins (gp120) and one of the enzymes (protease). However, the models generated for those two proteins could explain between 30% and 40% of ($$ dN/dS $$). We found that glycosylations in the gp120 protein could not predict evolution better than simply RSA or distance from the apical surface. Finally, we showed with a very conservative cross-validation scheme that adding distance from an optimized reference point significantly improves evolutionary predictions in the majority of HIV proteins.

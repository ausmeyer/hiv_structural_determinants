### Obtaining and preparing HIV gene sequences

All of our sequences came from the HIV database at Los Alamos National Laboratory ([HIV Database](http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/index)). We used only pre-made gene alignments. The alignments were assumed correct and therefore not changed for all of the genes in this study. To identify the genes in the whole genome sequences, we used the annotation landmarks available in the sequence database ([HIV Landmarks](http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HIV/MAP/landmark.html)). The sequences were filtered to only include those with entirely canonical bases. 

### Obtaining and mapping protein structures

### Calculating evolutionary rates

### Building models and mapping back to the protein structures

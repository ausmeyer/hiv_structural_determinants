Protein structure, measured by relative solvent accessibility, serves as a general constraint on the evolution of viral proteins. It was recently shown that distance from functional surfaces may explain an additional portion of the evolution of the viral receptor-binding proteins. However, the general applicability of distance constraints to explain viral protein adaptation remains an open question. Furthermore, it is not known whether or not these constraints act uniformly for all of the proteins in a single virus, nor is it known if these constraints are important for rapidly mutating retroviruses. Therefore, we have carried out an analysis of structural predictors of site-wise $$ dN/dS $$ in HIV-1. Our results indicate that structural constraints do not act uniformly in HIV-1 and that each contraint (RSA and distance) show mixed results for HIV. Of the two broad categories of HIV proteins we surveyed, neither showed a common pattern of adaptive evolution or modeling accuracy. Structural constraints were highly predictive in just one of the three enzymes and one of three structural proteins in HIV-1. For those two proteins, the protease enzyme and the gp120 structural protein, structure could explain between 30% and 40% of the variation in $$ dN/dS $$. In addition, we found that glycosylations in the gp120 protein could explain just 2% of the variation in $$ dN/dS $$ and could not explain its evolution independently from either RSA or distance from the apical surface. Finally, we found with a very conservative cross-validation scheme that adding distance from an optimized reference point significantly improves evolutionary predictions in the majority of HIV proteins.

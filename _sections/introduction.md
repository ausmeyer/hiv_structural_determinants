Despite the development of dozens of antiretrovirals, decades of vaccine development, and billions spent to halt transmission, HIV-1 remains a major public health concern. Part of the difficulty in combating the HIV epidemic lies in the viruses ability to adapt to even the most complex combined therapeutic schedules. This issue stems from the fact that HIV is among the most rapidly mutating human viruses, a large intra-patient population size, and a high replication rate ([Mansky and Temin 1995](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7541846), [Frost et al. 2005](https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0504658102), [Wei et al. 1995](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/373117a0), [Perelson et al. 1996 ](https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.271.5255.1582), [Perelson et al. 197](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/387188a0), [Chun et al. 1997](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/387183a0)). Moreover, identifying specific selection pressures, the strength of those pressures, and the HIV proteins that are adapting most rapidly is still not well understood.

There is evidence in at least one HIV-1 gene (*env*), that evolution occurs through a number of mechanisms that might suggest various patterns of evolution of the receptor-binding protein; one such hypothesis is the glycan shield whereby the virus shift glycosylation patterns to block antibody binding directly ([Wei et al. 2002](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature01470)). However, the glycan shield hypothesis appears to not play out in sequence evolution ([Frost et al. 2005](https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0504658102)). Moreover, beyond the *env* gene, relatively little is known about the pattern of site-wise positive and negative selection in HIV. It may be the case that HIV proteins generally evolve by similar constraints to eukaryotic proteins. Likewise, it might be that folding constraints like the relative solvent accessibility (RSA) of an amino acid or distance from a functional surface may act uniformly across all HIV proteins. Or conversely, it may be that the human immune systems applies such asymmetric evolutionary pressures that none of the traditional constraints work for such a rapidly adapting virus.

**Still working here**

In this study, we examine the structural predictors of $$ dN/dS $$ in HIV-1. We find that, similar to influenza, RSA and distance to an optimized reference point are generally significant predictors of virus evolution. Additionally, we find that five out of the six models we produce are significant, but only two can be considered particular strong; those two models account for between 30% and 40% of $$ dN/dS $$. In addition, we find that HIV integrase is the first protein out of many hundred tested by several independent studies that does not have a single statistically significant structural predictor of site-wise evolution. For gp120, we also examine the ability of glycosylations to explain $$ dN/dS $$. The sites within four angstroms of glycosylations can partially predict the evolution of gp120. However, after controlling for either of the structural constraints we use in combined models, glycosylations lose all statistically power. Thus, we find that glycosylations in the gp120 protein can not predict evolution better than simply RSA or distance from the apical surface. Finally, we find, with a very conservative cross-validation scheme, that adding distance from an optimized reference point significantly improves evolutionary predictions in the majority of HIV proteins.

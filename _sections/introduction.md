In this study, we examine the structural predictors of $$ dN/dS $$ in HIV-1. We find that, similar to influenza, RSA and distance to an optimized reference point are generally significant predictors of virus evolution. Additionally, we find that five out of the six models we produce are significant, but only two can be considered particular strong; those two models account for between 30% and 40% of $$ dN/dS $$. In addition, we find that HIV integrase is the first protein out of many hundred tested by several independent studies that does not have a single statistically significant structural predictor of site-wise evolution. For gp120, we also examine the ability of glycosylations to explain $$ dN/dS $$. The sites within four angstroms of glycosylations can partially predict the evolution of gp120. However, after controlling for either of the structural constraints we use in combined models, glycosylations lose all statistically power. Thus, we find that glycosylations in the gp120 protein can not predict evolution better than simply RSA or distance from the apical surface. Finally, we find, with a very conservative cross-validation scheme, that adding distance from an optimized reference point significantly improves evolutionary predictions in the majority of HIV proteins.
